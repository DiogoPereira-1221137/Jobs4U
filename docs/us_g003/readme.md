# US G003

## 1. Context

In this user story we had to research tools to facilitate the development of the next user stories. In this way we had to analyze the documentation of these tools, as well as research how to implement them in our project
## 2. Requirements

**US G003** As Project Manager, I want the team to configure the project structure to facilitate / accelerate the development of upcoming user stories.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- G003.1.Define the structure of the project to support the envisioned architecture, such as presented in Chapter 4, including support for adopted technologies
  (e.g., ANTLR)

**Dependencies/References:**

*Regarding this requirement we understand that it relates to LPROG * 

## 3. Analysis

We had to analyze the documentation of these tools, as well as research how to implement them in our project.
To use ANTLR on Intellij you need to install a plugin entitled "ANTLR v4", then you have all the tools you need.
