## 1. Context

[//]: # (*Explain the context for this task. It is the first time the task is assigned to be developed or this tasks was incomplete in a previous sprint and is to be completed in this sprint? Are we fixing some bug?*)

This is a task that defines the tool to be used by the team for repository and project management over the course of the project.

## 2. Requirements

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (*In this section you should present the functionality that is being developed, how do you understand it, as well as possible correlations to other requirements &#40;i.e., dependencies&#41;. You should also add acceptance criteria.*)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (*Example*)

**US G002** As Project Manager, I want the team to use the defined project repository (i.e.,GitHub) and setup a tool for project management.

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (**Dependencies/References:**)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (*Regarding this requirement we understand that it relates to...*)

## 3. Analysis

[//]: # (*In this section, the team should report the study/analysis/comparison that was done in order to take the best design decisions for the requirement. This section should also include supporting diagrams/artifacts &#40;such as domain model; use case diagrams, etc.&#41;,*)

The team looked up how to use the tool of choice, GitHub, and experimented with its features to varying degrees in order to learn to use the tool effectively for Version Control and Project Management.

GitHub provides many features that the team is using. Aside from the expected Git functionalities, there is a built-in project management board akin to other tools like Trello or Jira, Issues that can be linked to specific commits, as well as a myriad of other features.

[//]: # (## 4. Design)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (*In this sections, the team should present the solution design that was adopted to solve the requirement. This should include, at least, a diagram of the realization of the functionality &#40;e.g., sequence diagram&#41;, a class diagram &#40;presenting the classes that support the functionality&#41;, the identification and rational behind the applied design patterns and the specification of the main tests used to validade the functionality.*)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (*In this section the team should present, if necessary, some evidencies that the implementation is according to the design. It should also describe and explain other important artifacts necessary to fully understand the implementation like, for instance, configuration files.*)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (*It is also a best practice to include a listing &#40;with a brief summary&#41; of the major commits regarding this requirement.*)

[//]: # (## 7. Observations)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (*This section should be used to include any content that does not fit any of the previous sections.*)

[//]: # ()
